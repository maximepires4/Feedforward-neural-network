# Feedforward neural network

Implement a simple version of the feedforward neural network using back propagation.

The model trains itself with data given in the file `data.txt`.
These datas contains list of points with their classes.
Once trained, the algorithm will solve this class problem for all the points on the graph, creating "boundaries".

## Usage

```
python ffnn.py
```

## Parameters

* Error

Add `-e` or `--error` to plot the error convergence

* Verbose

Add `-v` or `--verbose` to print output weights and simulated output
